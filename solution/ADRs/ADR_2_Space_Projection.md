## Context
During a Kata time is of the essence for both the judges and the partakers. Visual representations can help us to make complex matters understandable. As an added benefit, it quickly conveys core concepts to the judges and other readers. The reader group includes our team members and any other interested parties.

## Decision
To concisely tell the story of our architecture, we use a technique that uses the visual parts of our brain to connect the dots between problems and their solutions. We call this technique Space Projection. We limit our use here to projecting issues from our problem space to solutions in our solution space.

## Consequences
We should make sure that we prefer visual representations using Space Projection. While this may take more time for us to "write," we will easily make up that time in our efforts to "read" the architecture.
