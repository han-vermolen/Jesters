# Architecture characteristics considerations

<p>We consider <b>"Hey, Blue!"</b> to be more than just a connecting(and forgetting) people application. It's core purpose is about fulfilling civilians and police officers' need of meaningful connections, connections that create trust and a real possibility to help others.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> This is the main reason we've chosen <b>Responsiveness</b> to be our top architecture characteristic: it's all about discovering the possibility of an interaction intantaneously, while people are still in proximity.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> We want <b>"Hey, Blue!"</b> to be broadly available, easy to use, easy to understand, easy to learn about. So, <b>Learnability</b> also became our top architecture characteristic.</p>
  
<p><b>3.</b> The connections are meant to be shared as an inspirations for the others. We strongly need the ability to interact with third party systems and make the accomplishments known to the world. This brings <b>Interoperability</b> in the top group of characteristics that influence our architecture decision.</p>
