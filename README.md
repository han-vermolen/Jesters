# Jesters
Welcome to the Jesters' solution for the 2022 Fall Kata. The Kata is hosted by O'Reilly Media and has been a fixture in the architecture space for about two years.

This page is your entry point to our architecture, and while you could rummage through our solution in any order you want, we highly advise you to follow the yellow brick road. It all starts right here!

# A map of our architecture
You can use the table of content (TOC) below to move directly to the chapter of your interest. We have also taken care to link any page to its consecutive page. So look for the link at the bottom. You can skip the returning to the TOC when you've just found your reading flow.

## Problem space

## Solution space
After we have laid out the issues, we naturally move into describing the solutions to our problem statements from the previous section.

### ADRs
This part contains all the Architecture Decision Records we've written to clarify our most impactful decisions.
